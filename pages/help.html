Should there be NO solution, file your feedback in a timely manner to Postalong for further negotiation due to Postalong's relevant provisions.<br>
11) Notify the receiver (accept services) about when and where to receive goods under delivering before the delivery task is completed. Anything related to the services payment fee, notify the consignor (service’s needs) or delivery task publisher to have the delivery fee paid in time.<br>
12) It is required for the carriers (services provider) to complete the delivery task on time. Complaints, claims and lawsuits from consignor or receiver caused by over-time delivery will be the full responsibility of the carriers (services provider) themselves. Postalong will supervise the whole process of the delivery. A net of fee will be deducted as a penalty for over-time delivery. If the amount of penalty is NOT sufficient to compensate the caused loss, the carriers (services provider) have to cover the remaining part of the loss all by themselves. Postalong reserves the right for further reimbursement from the carrier (services provider);<br>
13) It's the receiver's (accept services) responsibility to double-check the consignor's (service’s needs) or the delivery task publisher's personal information, including the names, phone contacts, etc.. It's the carrier's (services provider) responsibility to handle the goods under delivery to the receiver (accept services), after having ensured the “Delivery Completed, Confirm” button is clicked either by the receiver (accept services) or by the consignor (service’s needs). <br>
14) If either refusal to accept the delivered goods by the receiver (accept services), or absence of the receiver (accept services) at the arranged time, the arranged place, or even NO way to get in touch with the receiver, happens, the carrier (services provider) should proactively talk to the consignor (service’s needs) or delivery task publisher.  If NO solution can be found between the carriers and the consigners, please contact Postalong in a timely manner for further negotiation.<br>
  </p>
<h3>3.  Carriers' (services provider) Income</h3>
<p>
1、1) Online payment from the consignor (service’s needs) or the delivery tasks publisher: either through Internet banks, stripe, wechat, or some other online payments to a unique Postalong account. The carriers (services provider) will get the services commission directly from Postalong after that. <br>
2) Postalong provides multiple methods, for the users themselves, to choose as their payment preference.
Withdraw: Direct withdrawal is permitted via personal bank account or some other payment account (relevant fees caused by the malicious cash withdrawal should be taken care of by the users themselves), but the bonus credits/points given by Postalong are NOT allowed to withdrawn. Postalong holds the right for the detailed interpretation.
